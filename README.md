#Guard, a simple form validator

The objective was to use HTML5 Form API to take advantage of the new attributes (required, pattern, placeholder) and methods (checkValidity), and create a small polyfill for older browsers. Of course this example is very limited, but you can have an idea of what I tried to achieve.

Even I've made some tests to ensure the validator it works as I expected.
